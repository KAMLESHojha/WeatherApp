# WeatherApp

Overview
WeatherApp is a web application that provides real-time weather information using the OpenWeather API. The app is built using Java Servlets, JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can search for the weather in any city and get details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Features

Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches up-to-date weather information from the OpenWeather API.
City Search: Users can search for the weather in any city around the world.
Dynamic Display: The weather details are dynamically displayed using JSP and updated without page reloads thanks to JavaScript.
User-Friendly Interface: The app has a clean and responsive design, making it easy to use on any device.
Technologies Used
Java Servlets: Handles the back-end logic and API requests.
JSP (JavaServer Pages): Renders the weather data and manages the front-end display.
HTML & CSS: Provides the structure and styling for the web pages.
JavaScript: Manages dynamic content updates and API interaction on the client side.
OpenWeather API: Supplies the weather data for the application.

How It Works
User Input: The user enters a city name into the search bar.
API Request: The Java Servlet sends a request to the OpenWeather API with the city name.
Data Processing: The Servlet processes the API response and forwards the weather data to the JSP page.
Display: The JSP page displays the weather information in a user-friendly format.
